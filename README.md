========

Code to demonstrate fundamentals of Apple's CMIO (CoreMediaIO) API for clients (not plugins).

This is intended as a demonstration of the API, and may be of use if you are developing a CMIO plugin.

It is not the best way of performing its function (displaying video from an attached device) - use a higher level API like AVFoundation for that.
